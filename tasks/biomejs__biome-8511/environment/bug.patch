-### Mark a rule as a work in progress
-
-Sometimes nursery rules aren't completed yet – missing use cases, code actions, etc. – and you might want to communicate that to your users.
-
-You can add `issue_number` to the rule macro, and Biome will:
-- Add a footnote to the diagnostic of the rule with a link to the issue, e.g. `https://github.com/biomejs/biome/issues/1111`
-- Add a note on the website, with a link to the issue.
