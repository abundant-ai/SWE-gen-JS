 - `unsubscribe: () => void`: removes the listener entry from the middleware, and prevent future instances of the listener from running. (This does _not_ cancel any active instances.)
 - `subscribe: () => void`: will re-subscribe the listener entry if it was previously removed, or no-op if currently subscribed
 - `cancelActiveListeners: () => void`: cancels all other running instances of this same listener _except_ for the one that made this call. (The cancellation will only have a meaningful effect if the other instances are paused using one of the cancellation-aware APIs like `take/cancel/pause/delay` - see "Cancelation and Task Management" in the "Usage" section for more details)
+- `cancel: () => void`: cancels the instance of this listener that made this call.
 - `signal: AbortSignal`: An [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) whose `aborted` property will be set to `true` if the listener execution is aborted or completed.
 
 Dynamically unsubscribing and re-subscribing this listener allows for more complex async workflows, such as avoiding duplicate running instances by calling `listenerApi.unsubscribe()` at the start of a listener, or calling `listenerApi.cancelActiveListeners()` to ensure that only the most recent instance is allowed to complete.

 ### Complex Async Workflows
 
-The provided async workflow primitives (`cancelActiveListeners`, `unsubscribe`, `subscribe`, `take`, `condition`, `pause`, `delay`) can be used to implement behavior that is equivalent to many of the more complex async workflow capabilities found in the Redux-Saga library. This includes effects such as `throttle`, `debounce`, `takeLatest`, `takeLeading`, and `fork/join`. Some examples from the test suite:
